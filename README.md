# Chess App

Chess App is being developed mainly to practice software development using the Java language, and a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach. As the development process goes on, I am getting familiarized with TDD, as well as with software development under an agile perspective.

This application is being developed with basis on exercises available in several chapters of the book  *Agile Java* by Jeff Langr.

As the project evolves, I will add more information on its class structure, and functionalities.

## Class structure

### `Pawn`

`Pawn` represents pawns. They can be created as black or white pawns.
